- Implement comprehensive data quality checks and validation pipelines
- Maintain data lineage and provenance tracking

### 2. **Global Accessibility**
- Design for international users with varying technical backgrounds
- Support multiple languages and regional data standards
- Ensure system works across different time zones and network conditions
- Provide clear educational context for oceanographic concepts

### 3. **Performance & Scalability**
- System must handle millions of oceanographic measurements efficiently
- Response times under 2 seconds for common queries
- Horizontal scaling capability for growing datasets
- Optimized database queries and caching strategies

### 4. **User Experience Excellence**
- Natural language interface that understands scientific terminology
- Intuitive web interface with progressive disclosure
- Clear error messages and helpful guidance
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile

### 5. **Modern Architecture**
- Microservices architecture for modularity and maintainability
- API-first design with comprehensive documentation
- Event-driven architecture for real-time data processing
- Cloud-native deployment with containerization

### 6. **Security & Privacy**
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Privacy-compliant data handling
- Regular security audits and updates
