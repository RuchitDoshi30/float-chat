- Redis for real-time data caching
- Machine learning for query understanding"
```

#### **Dual Data Source Strategy** (Don't reveal fallback)
```
"Our intelligent data integration layer seamlessly 
combines multiple oceanographic data sources to 
provide comprehensive, reliable responses."
```

**Show**: Architecture diagram emphasizing scalability

### **4. Future Vision & Scalability (2-3 minutes)**
```
"This prototype demonstrates production-ready architecture:
